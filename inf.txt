To run a Python script in debug mode, you can use a debugger tool such as pdb or pycharm.

To use pdb, you need to insert the line "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()" at the point where you want the debugger to stop and ask for input.

For example, if you have a script named "my_script.py", you can run it in debug mode using the following command:

```
python -m pdb my_script.py
```

This will start your code and stop at the first line of the module. From there, you can enter "n" to execute the next statement, "s" to step inside a function call, "q" to quit the debugger, and other commands.

Alternatively, if you are using an IDE like PyCharm, you can set breakpoints at specific lines of code and debug the script by clicking the "debug" button. This will allow you to step through your code, inspect variables, and more.
